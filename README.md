This project is a responsive image slider created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides an interactive way to showcase a collection of images, allowing users to navigate through the slides using left and right arrows.

This is a small part of a broader project and can be integrated into different use-cases to beauty websites while adding specific purposes like moving through different options to choose from.
